</p>

C. Accounts on the Service.

<p>
    Your Service account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to the Service with a third-party service, such as Facebook, Amazon, Google+, or any other third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.

</p>
You may only use and operate one (1) User account at a time unless you have otherwise been given express prior written permission to do so from Multi App. You may never use another User's account without permission. Further, you may not sell, gift, trade, or transfer your User account to any other User for any reason whatsoever.

<p>
    When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Multi App immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Multi App will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.
</p>
<p>

"Streaming" means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Service to a User's device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the User.
</p>
<p>
    We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Service.

<strong>

    2. User Content
</strong>

<p>

    Multi App develops and publishes free-to-play mobile games and social apps that are also available to play synchronously cross-platform across the web, iOS and Android platforms.
</p>
<p>

    Some areas of the Service allow Users to post or provide content such as profile information, videos, images, music, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service is referred to as"User Content"). We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by providing or sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with your settings and this Agreement. Multi App has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.
</p>
<p>


    You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party's trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current or (ix) violates any school or other applicable policy, including those related to cheating or ethics. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. To the extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including without limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the power to grant the license granted below. Multi App reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Multi App believes, in its sole discretion, violates any of these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer's Guild of America, or any other rights organization.
</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property Rights" means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>


    In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:
</p>
<p>

    A. You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content, if any, to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.
</p>
<p>


    B. You have obtained and are solely responsible for obtaining all consents as may be required by law to post any User Content relating to third parties.
</p>
<p>

    C. Your User Content and Multi App' use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.
</p>
<p>

    D. Multi App may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise. Multi App takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts, sends, or otherwise makes available over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on the Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Multi App shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of or relating to any User Content.
</p>


<strong>3. User Content License Grant</strong>


<p>
    By posting or otherwise making available any User Content on or through the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Multi App a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Multi App' (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.
</p>


<strong> Mobile Software</strong>


A. Mobile Software
<p>

You may use mobile data in connection with the Mobile Software and may incur additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. Multi App hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one (1) account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software. You acknowledge that Multi App may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device.

Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and Multi App or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. Multi App reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. If the Mobile Software is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. The Mobile Software will be deemed to be "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service. The Mobile Software originates in the United States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The Mobile Software may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile Software may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Software and the Service.

You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and/or use of the Apple-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Apple-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to Multi App as provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Apple-Sourced Software or your possession and use of that Apple-Sourced Software infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Multi App, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and Multi App acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the Apple-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates to your license of the Apple-Sourced Software against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.

<strong>
    15. Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action Waiver
</strong>


<p>This Section (i.e., the “Agreement to Arbitrate”) applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of provisions of this Section Agreement to Arbitrate notwithstanding Section Applicable Law below, those prohibited provisions will not apply to you.



    In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination or breach thereof, or your use of Multi App Services or any related services, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. Most user concerns can be resolved by contacting our customer support team at waxmoon2023@gmail.com. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains, this Section explains how you and we agree to resolve it. As explained in more detail below, we each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.



    If we cannot resolve our dispute through customer support, you and we agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration, including claims concerning any aspect of the relationship between us, your decision to download Multi App Services, your use of Multi App Services, any user content, or your account. This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly, and applies to all legal claims under any legal theory (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory), and applies to any disputes or claims that you assert or that arise even after you stop using or delete your account for Multi App Services, stop using Multi App Services, or delete Multi App Services application from your mobile device. This Agreement to Arbitrate also applies to any claims that are currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. You and we agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of the terms or formation of this contract, including whether any dispute between us is subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate (i.e., the arbitrator will decide the arbitrability of any dispute) and whether all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.



    An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. You understand that you and we are giving up the right to sue in court and the right to have a trial before a judge or jury.



    This Section Agreement to Arbitrate, however, does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or we may bring in court in accordance with Section Applicable Law below:

</p>

<p>
    (1) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and

    (2) claims for preliminary injunctive relief for violations of sections No Transfer and Code of Conduct herein.

</p>
<p>
    This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you. Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in Santa Clara County, California or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if such claims meets all the requirements to be brought in that court.

</p>
<p>
    The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section Agreement to Arbitrate. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (including Rule 1(g) of those Rules that provides for arbitration through the submission of documents only/desk arbitration where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000), as modified by these Terms of Use. The Rules are available at http://www.adr.org. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms of Use.

</p>
<p>
    To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form on AAA’s website (www.adr.org) or call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
</p>

<p>
    Any arbitration under this section that is required to take place in person will take place pursuant to the Rules, which provide that face-to-face proceedings be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.

</p>

FOR NON-US USERS:

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination or breach thereof, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. If they do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by any party to the other(s), any unresolved controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“ICDR”) (www.icdr.org) in accordance with the provisions of its International Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be in London, England. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of Multi App. The European Union also operates an online dispute resolution platform which can be found at www.ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.
</p>


CLASS ACTION WAIVER
<p>
    For disputes arising between Multi App and you, or any other user, that are subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, you and we agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. Neither you nor we can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class, or representative arbitration proceeding, unless we both agree otherwise in writing. The arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only affect the person who brought the claim, not other users of Multi App Services, and cannot be used to decide disputes with others.

    If a court decides that this “Class Action Waiver” subsection is not enforceable or is invalid, then Section Agreement to Arbitrate shall cease to have effect, however, the remaining portions of the Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect.

    You understand that you would have had a right to litigate through a court, to have a judge or jury decide your case and to be party to a class or representative action. However, you understand and choose to have any claims decided individually and only through arbitration.
</p>

<strong>
    16. Applicable Law
</strong>
<p>
    You agree that these Terms of Use shall be deemed to have been made and executed in China and that any dispute arising under the Terms of Use, as well as any other dispute or claim that may arise between you and us, shall be governed by and resolved in accordance with the laws of  China, without regard to conflict of law provisions or principals.

    19. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Notice</strong>
<p>
    Multi App responds to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).

    Please note: The DMCA provides that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you falsely claim that content is infringing your copyright. We recommend contacting an attorney if you are unsure whether your content is protected by copyright law or whether content is infringing on your copyright.
